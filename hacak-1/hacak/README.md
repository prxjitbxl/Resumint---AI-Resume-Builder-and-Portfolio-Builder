# ResuMint AI — Hackathon Landing Page

This is a high-impact, judge-friendly landing page for an **AI-Assisted Resume + Portfolio Builder**.

## Run locally (Windows)
- Open `index.html` in Chrome/Edge (double-click).
- Or right-click → **Open with** → your browser.

## What makes it “judge-impressive”
- **Unique palette + premium UI**: “mint plasma” gradients + glassmorphism + subtle motion.
- **Interactive demo**: type notes → generates **impact-first** resume bullets + a simple clarity/impact score.
- **Clear differentiation**: “Signal Graph” concept (maps content to hiring signals: impact/ownership/scope/tech depth).

## Quick judge pitch (use this)
ResuMint AI is a resume + portfolio builder that’s **signal-first**. Instead of only formatting text, it maps your
projects and experience to hiring signals like impact, ownership, and tech depth — then rewrites bullets with measurable
outcomes, keeps everything ATS-friendly, and generates a matching portfolio page from the same source profile.
