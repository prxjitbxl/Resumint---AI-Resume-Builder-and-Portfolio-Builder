## 🚀 About Resumint
ResuMint is a high-impact, AI-assisted **Resume & Portfolio Builder** designed to help students and professionals create "judge-impressive" profiles. It goes beyond simple formatting by focusing on **hiring signals**—Impact, Ownership, and Tech Depth.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Signal-First Approach**: Maps your experience to key hiring signals instead of just listing responsibilities.
- **AI-Powered ATS Checker**: Real-time analysis of your resume for Application Tracking System (ATS) compatibility.
  - Checks for metrics, keywords, structure, and buzzwords.
  - Provides a "Clarity/Impact Score".
- **Interactive Portfolio Builder**: Generates a matching portfolio page directly from your resume profile.
- **Premium UI**: Features a "Mint Plasma" design with glassmorphism and subtle motion effects.
- **Local Storage**: Saves your profile data locally in your browser so you don't lose your work.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with variables for theming (Mint Plasma design)
- **No Frameworks**: Lightweight and fast, built without heavy dependencies.
